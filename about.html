					<p>I believe we all can recall a time when we've encountered a very well designed place or product for the very first time. That rush of excitement as you immerse yourself in every detail; perhaps an ergonomic masterpiece for a given task, or a perfect material used in the perfect place. Everything in the design feels right and in your head you scream, "Yes! That makes so much sense!" Like fitting the last puzzle piece in its place, but in our brain. And for just a moment the world is as it should be.</p>
					<p>That's the kind of feeling that motivates me as a designer. When I encounter a well-designed product I can't help but admire all of the work that went into its creation. As a designer myself, I want to create products and experiences that feel like Cinderella and her glass slipper: the perfect fit.</p>
					<p>For me that kind of design starts with understanding who you're designing for. There is no true one-size-fits-all solution. Every culture/group/individual has different needs, wants and expectations and it's my job as a designer to understand and design for those circumstances.</p>
