        <h3>A Unique Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Hart Audio Cables is a fledgling company based out of Texas that specializes in creating custom, high quality cables for headphones. HAC's cables are known for their unique interconnect system, allowing one headphone cable to work
          with every device you
          own.

        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <h1>Empathize</h1>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          I first sought to understand how people felt about the sites current purchasing process. Where were the pain points and issues, and is there even a problem to solve?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          HAC's products have quickly become the favorite aftermarket cable supplier of a large portion of the high-end headphone community. You will very regularly see their name mentioned in recommendations as well as user reviews. While
          experienced audiophiles will have no problems understanding HAC's unique approach to headphone cables, amateurs to the hobby and first time buyers may struggle to understand how to purchase a proper cable set, and which cable set to
          purchase. HAC has acknowledged this as a potential issue on their website and offers customers the opportunity to direclty email them. While a solution, this process is entirely manual and adds a large delay on the purchasing process.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A simplified, approachable, and intuitive purchasing experience could not only encourage users to purchase HAC's products, but this would also alleviate manual labor from HAC's small team.

          To answer these questions I gathered 10 users of hartaudiocables.com in order to gather opinions. These users were found via online forums, and all willingly chose to volunteer their time.

        <h6>Key Takeaways</h6>
        <ul list-style="circle outside">
          <li>Current site is overly verbose. A large portion of the site is uninterrupted text with no variation which is bad for attention retention.</li>
