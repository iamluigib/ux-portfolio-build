        <h3>A Unique Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Hart Audio Cables is a fledgling company based out of Texas that specializes in creating custom, high quality cables for headphones. HAC's cables are known for their unique interconnect system, allowing one headphone cable to work
          with every device you
          own.

        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <h1>Empathize</h1>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          I first sought to understand how people felt about the hartaudiocables.com current purchasing process. Where were the pain points and issues, and is there even a problem to solve?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          HAC's products have quickly become a favorite aftermarket cable supplier of a significant portion of the high-end headphone community. You will very regularly see their name mentioned in recommendations as well as user reviews. While
          experienced audiophiles will have no problems understanding HAC's unique approach to headphone cables, amateurs to the hobby and first time buyers may struggle to understand how to purchase a proper cable set, and which cable set to
          purchase. HAC has acknowledged this as a potential issue on their website and offers customers the opportunity to direclty email them. While a solution, this process is entirely manual and adds a large delay on the purchasing process.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The question was: <em>could a simplified, approachable, and intuitive purchasing experience better educate and encourage new users into purchasing HAC's products, and also alleviate manual labor from HAC's small team?</em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To answer these questions, I found 5 users who have not used heartaudiocables.com but were technically familiar with the items. These users were found in various ways, including online forums and personal acquantainces and all willingly
          chose to volunteer their time for the benefit of
          this study.

        <span class="card-title">User Research</span>
        <p>
          Users were given a pair of headphones (Hifiman Sundaras) and asked to find the appropriate cable replacement and it to their cart. After, they were asked a series of qustions.

        <h6>Key Takeaways</h6>
        <ul list-style="circle outside">
          <li>40% of testers felt they had chosen the right product.</li>
          <li>20% of testers felt like they understood the buying process.</li>
          <li>It took an average of 11 minutes to complete the test.</li>
          <li>Current site is overly verbose. A large portion of the site is uninterrupted text with no variation or emphasis, discouraging testers from reading.</li>
          <li>The site offers interconnects and headphone cables, but one of each is required to make a working cable. This process, in particular the use of the term "interconnect," were major pain points.</li>
          <li>Proprietary code names are used to classify all of the interconnect and headphone cable types, which caused additional confusion for the majority of testers who are already famililar with their industry standard names.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          While Hart Audio Cables offers unique and high quality aftermarket audio cables, their unusual purchasing process and customer terminology can be intimidating for new users who can easily get overwhelmed.
